# How to modify/build this site

This is not like a typical GitHub Pages site:

* You have to build it yourself.
* Use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to build it, not jekyll
* The generated site lives in the `/docs` folder, and all
  files that Hugo generates in this folder need to be added 
  to the Git repository (in the `master` branch).
